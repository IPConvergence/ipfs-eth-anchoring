# Simple Ethereum + InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)+ React.jsÂ DApp

A simple DApp to upload a document to IPFS and then store the IPFS hash on the Ethereum blockchain. Once the IPFS hash number is sent to the Ethereum blockchain, the user will receive a transaction receipt. We will use Create-React-App framework to make a front-end. This Dapp works with any user that has MetaMask installed in their browser.
